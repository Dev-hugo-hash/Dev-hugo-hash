<h1>Hi! my name is Vitor Hugo</h1> 
<br>
<h2>I am 18 years old and I have been a developer for two years</h2>                   <br>

<p>I currently work as a backend developer in development.</p>
<p>I use Node.js technology for my work with Express libraries, nodemon, among 
others, however I also know a lot about the C # language (Csharp) and some database administrators
such as SQL Server and Hbase. I like to always look for new
challenges that encourage my professional growth.</>
  <br>
<h3>I also have notions of how the HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools work, and I have already done small test projects with them</h3>
