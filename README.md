Hi! my name is Vitor Hugo, I am 18 years old and I have been a developer for two years                                                 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I currently work as a backend developer in development.
I use Node.js technology for my work with Express libraries, nodemon, among 
others, however I also know a lot about the C # language (Csharp) and some database administrators
such as SQL Server and Hbase. I like to always look for new
challenges that encourage my professional growth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also have notions of how the HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools work, and I have already done small test projects with them
